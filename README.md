## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Rutvik PATEL

_Student NetID_: rsp7

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: TSA
- Assumptions:
  - One critical assumption I am making is that as the head of the TSA, I have the legal authority to implement the countermeasures below. Another assumption is that certain strategies offering near-guaranteed security, such as a comprehensive examination of all items on one's person and in one's luggage performed in isolation, are infeasible due to privacy and time constraints. In particular, there is only so much that a flyer is willing to tolerate. Due to the high level of traffic that airports receive on a daily basis, there is also a constraint stemming from personnel costs.
- Assets:
  - The most important assets I would like to protect are the users of American airports. This collection of people includes not just citizens and visitors, but also airport staff. I have a moral desire (and obligation) to prevent the deaths of these people at the hands of terrorists. In addition, the media fallout from a successful terrorist attack would be catastrophic and my reputation could be tarnished. Such attacks can also instill fear in the public and diminish trust in the government.
  - Another asset that is important for me to protect is the physical infrastructure of airports. Modern airports are the result of tremendous monetary investment in construction and maintenance costs, and it would be no small endeavour to repair the damage caused by a terrorist attack. A related asset to protect is the physical integrity of airplanes, which are similarly expensive.
  - Finally, it is important to protect the personal privacy of flyers (which can be threatened by some physical screening processes) as well as their ability to rely on airports for efficient transportation.
- Threats:
  - Airports constitute a natural target for terrorism, because they gather large numbers of people together for mass transit. The stereotypical mode of operation is the detonation of explosive devices either on a plane or in the airport itself, although there are other scenarios to consider. For instance, a terrorist might smuggle weapons onto a plane in an attempt to kill people individually. The consequences are so dire that terrorism is a threat that I cannot afford to ignore.
  - Another threat that I choose to defend against is illicit passage through the airport. More specifically, it is important to prevent wanted persons from accessing air transport, and, to a lesser extent, it is important to ensure that passengers have paid for a ticket. This threat is not limited to the passage of people, however; it is also worth protecting against the smuggling of controlled substances in one's luggage, for example.
- Countermeasures:
  - Metal detectors, used in conjunction with instructions to remove common metal-containing objects from one's person before moving through them, can defend against the smuggling of weapons and other illegal items onto a plane. Wave scanners accomplish the same thing, and allow security personnel to check the contents of luggage in a non-invasive manner. Although these countermeasures are expensive, they represent an investment that most airports have already made. On the other hand, the benefit is enormous, because these measures are the best line of defense we have against terrorism.
  - The use of standardized procedures (to verify identity, for instance) can guard against illicit passage. They are also important because they neutralize the chaos that an adversary would like to effect in the aftermath of a successful assault. A related countermeasure is the use of recording equipment like cameras to aid in investigations of successful attacks, which are useful to prevent future attacks. Costs can be minimized by upfront training of personnel and on-demand (as opposed to continuous) review of records.
  - Finally, maintaining strong deterrents is critical. An obvious one imposes strict legal consequences for terrorism. The use of armed guards to monitor the inspection process is particularly powerful, justifying its high cost. Although this may be out of the scope of this scenario, planting undercover guards on flights can also deter assaults.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that, for administrative or logistical reasons, I am the only grader for the class of 200+ students. For simplicity, I will assume that the class is an introductory, core computer science course at Rice University, and that the class roster represents an average set of computer science majors at Rice. Hence most, but not all, of the students respect the Honor Code. Lastly, I assume that the homework is written (i.e., no programming involved), with submissions required to be through Canvas, typeset, and strictly on time.
